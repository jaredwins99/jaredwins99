Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Winslow (@jaredwins99)

I'm a master's student studying statistics at Columbia University, looking to enter the quantitative trading industry. My background is in mathematics, and I have 3.5 years of experience tutoring math, from high school material to senior-level seminars. Right now, I'm polishing my quantitative problem solving skills and broadening my statistical and programming expertise, while also learning more about the financial markets.

Recently, I worked with an environmental agency and developed a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model with co-regionalization to predict lead contamination in soil from X-ray fluorescence. The key difficulty in managing geospatial data is its inherent spatial autocorrelation. GPs solve this by implicitly positing a smooth prior over the space, a strategy that I think can be leveraged in analyzing highly-correlated market data.
