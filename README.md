Hi, I’m Jared Winslow (@jaredwins99)

I'm a master's student studying statistics at Columbia University. My background is in mathematics, and I have four years of experience tutoring math and other quantitative subjects, from high school material to fourth-year math seminars. Right now, I'm polishing my quantitative problem solving skills and broadening my statistical and programming expertise.

Recently, I worked with an environmental agency and developed a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model with co-regionalization to predict lead contamination in soil from X-ray fluorescence. The key difficulty in managing geospatial data is its inherent spatial autocorrelation. GPs solve this by implicitly positing a smooth prior over the space, enabling enhanced prediction.
