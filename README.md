Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Winslow (@jaredwins99)

I'm a recent mathematics graduate from Indiana University, looking to enter the quantitative trading industry. Right now, I'm polishing my quantitative problem solving skills and broadening my statistical and programming expertise. In addition, I'm learning as much as I can about market making and high frequency trading.

So far, I have added an independent finance project to GitHub that I have been working on.
