Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Winslow (@jaredwins99)

I'm a recent mathematics graduate from Indiana University, looking to enter the quantitative trading industry. Right now, I'm polishing my probability & statistics skills and learning as much as I can about market making and high frequency trading.

So far, I have added an independent finance project I have been working on.
