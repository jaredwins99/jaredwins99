Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Winslow (@jaredwins99)

I'm a master's student studying statistics at Columbia University. My background is in mathematics: I have five years of experience tutoring math and other quantitative subjects, from high school to graduate seminars. Right now, I'm broadening my statistical and programming expertise.

Selected projects I've worked on:
- Probabilistic machine learning: Developed a co-regionalized Gaussian Process (GP) regression model to predict lead contamination in soil from X-ray fluorescence, helping an environmental firm remediate a real-world lead hazard. The difficulty in managing geospatial data is in its significant spatial autocorrelation. GPs solve this by implicitly positing a smooth prior over the space, enabling enhanced prediction and uncertainty quantification.
- Interpretable deep learning research: Evaluated layerwise-relevance-propagation as a method for attributing feature importance in neural networks, using complex simulated data with network structures. LRP backtracks feature importance using customized layer-dependent heuristics, but it has difficulty correctly attributing importance when features are interrelated in nontrivial ways.
